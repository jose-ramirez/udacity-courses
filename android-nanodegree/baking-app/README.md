## Submission for the Android Nanodegree's Project 3, Baking App.

App for [Android Developer Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree--nd801). 
Android Baking App that will allow Udacityâ€™s resident baker-in-chief, Miriam, to share her recipes with the world. You will create an app that will allow a user to select a recipe and see video-guided steps for how to complete it.

## Extra(s)
Besides the minimum requirements, the app has an additional feature: when using headphones, the video will stop (eventually) if they are unpplugged from the phone.
