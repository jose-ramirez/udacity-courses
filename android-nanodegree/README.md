#Submission for the Android Nanodegree's Project 1, Stage 1.

This is my Udacity Android Developer Nano Degree Project 1 - Popular Movies Stage 1 project.

So far, this app does the following:

- Load popular and top rated movies from the Movies DB API.
- The user can select between the popular and top rated movies.
- The user can select a movie and view its details.

# Running the project

**IMPORTANT** You must get your own Movies DB API key [here](https://www.themoviedb.org/) to run this app.

Once you get your API key, put it in the string resource file **strings.xml**.
